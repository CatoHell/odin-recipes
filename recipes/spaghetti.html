        <ol>
            <li>Make the Sauce: First, you'll make the meat sauce for the Spaghetti! Brown the ground beef and then add the aromatics and seasonings. </br>Next, you'll add the marinara sauce, parmesan rind, bay leaf, and simmer for 15-20 minutes. Lastly, you'll stir in the chopped spinach until wilted and set aside while you prep the rest of the lasagna.</li>
            <li>Make the Ricotta Filling: Add the ricotta, lemon juice, black pepper, parmesan, parsley, and chopped basil to a mixing bowl. Stir until well combined.</li>
            <li>Boil the Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles to the boiling hot water and cook for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent them from sticking. Remove the noodles from the water and drain.</li>
