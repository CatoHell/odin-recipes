            <li>Lasagna Noodles: we're using 12 lasagna noodle sheets for this dish.</li>
            <li>Marinara Sauce: You can use your favorite jarred marinara sauce for this recipe which keeps things nice and easy.</li>
            <li>Zucchini: I like to add a layer of sliced zucchini for an easy way to get in extra veggies.</li>
            <li>Spinach: we're adding a bit of fresh spinach to the meat sauce for even more of those veggies.</li>
            <li>Ground Beef and Italian Sausage: we're making this lasagna extra flavorful by using a combination of ground beef and Italian sausage</li>
            <li>Parmesan Rind: to give the meat sauce even more flavor we're adding in a parmesan rind while the sauce simmers.</li>
            <li>Lemon Juice: this adds a bit more fresh flavor to the ricotta mixture. </li>
            <li>Cheese: a combination of classic ricotta cheese, parmesan, and of course mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Herbs and Seasonings: fresh herbs, Italian seasonings, and loads of fresh garlic.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Step</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the Sauce: First, you'll make the meat sauce for the lasagna! Brown the ground beef and then add the aromatics and seasonings. </br>Next, you'll add the marinara sauce, parmesan rind, bay leaf, and simmer for 15-20 minutes. Lastly, you'll stir in the chopped spinach until wilted and set aside while you prep the rest of the lasagna.</li>
            <li>Make the Ricotta Filling: Add the ricotta, lemon juice, black pepper, parmesan, parsley, and chopped basil to a mixing bowl. Stir until well combined.</li>
            <li>Boil the Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles to the boiling hot water and cook for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent them from sticking. Remove the noodles from the water and drain.</li>
        </ol>
